Proposed Solution Architecture:
1. MAD Token Implementation
Create ERC20 token contract on Starknet
Implement token distribution for approved submissions
Add token staking for approvers
Create token economics (burning, rewards, etc.)

2. Proper Data Storage
Integrate IPFS for decentralized storage
Implement file validation and processing
Add metadata extraction for images/text
Create content addressing and verification

3. Approval System Redesign
Implement role-based approver system
Add community voting mechanisms
Create quality scoring algorithms
Implement dispute resolution

4. Enhanced Data Handling
Add text processing and validation
Implement image analysis and metadata extraction
Create data quality metrics
Add content moderation
